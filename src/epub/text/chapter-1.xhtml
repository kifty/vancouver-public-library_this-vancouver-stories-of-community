<h1>Inez Cook: “Don’t Panic We Have Bannock”</h1>

<i>Inez Cook was interviewed the 25th of July, 2017, at The Drum is Calling Festival in Larwill Park as part of the This Vancouver Story City project. This is an excerpt of a longer interview.
</i>

<h3>Inez Cook:</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Inez Cook and I am Nuxalk from the Nuxalk Nation from Bella Coola and I was adopted and I grew up in Vancouver. I am the co-founder of Salmon n’ Bannock Bistro. We’re located at 1128 West Broadway. And I was just at <i>The Drum is Calling Festival</i> doing a food demo. And I thought I’d come over and say a little friendly hello.</p>
<h3>Interviewer:</h3>
<p>Well hello Inez, can you tell us about your childhood in Vancouver?</p>
<h3>Inez Cook:</h3>
<p>Well my childhood in Vancouver, well we kind of lived all over. We started in Burnaby and then Delta then we moved to Northwest Territory for a couple months and then came back. And we lived in East Van, then we lived downtown. Kinda moved all around the west, lower mainland. Yeah, I grew up here this is my home. I lived all over the world but it’s always nice to come home. I feel like if I’m away, I miss the ocean.</p>
<h3>Interviewer:</h3>
<p>Can I ask you, what is it that keeps bringing you back Inez?</p>
<h3>Inez Cook:</h3>
<p>Family and the ocean.</p>
<h3>Interviewer:</h3>
<p>There you go. So are you comfortable talking about your relationship to your culture?</p>
<h3>Inez Cook:</h3>
<p>Yeah, absolutely. I was adopted out so I only started really learning about my culture through my restaurant and I was fortunate enough to get reconnected with my biological family. I went up to Bella Coola and I met 500 relatives in a three day potlatch. I received my traditional name which is Snitsmana which means the protector of the sacred dance and lively. I received my button blanket the beginning of my regalia. I’m truly honored, and now I showcase my heritage with pride.</p>
<h3>Interviewer:</h3>
<p>Tell us how you do that.</p>
<h3>Inez Cook:</h3>
<p>Well at Salmon n’ Bannock restaurant on Broadway, all my staff is First Nations we take all indigenous ingredients and serve it with a modern palate, and I’m mentoring people, and I do as much as I can for the community and I’m super proud.</p>
<h3>Interviewer:</h3>
<p>How has it changed your life?
<h3>Inez Cook:</h3>
<p>Oh my goodness. I came full circle. I finally felt good in my own skin. That’s how it changed my life. It was epic. I spent my entire life searching for culture and I’ve always had it within, it’s really special.</p>
<h3>Interviewer:</h3>
<p>Were you raised by a non-indigenous family?</p>
<h3>Inez Cook:</h3>
<p>Correct. I was raised in a really good home. I am part of the class action lawsuit Sixties Scoop and originally I didn’t want to participate because I was given a good life but I realized that a lot of people weren’t as fortunate. And at the end of the day it wasn’t right, it wasn’t the government’s decision to make. And so, therefore I put my name on the class action lawsuit because there are strength in numbers and the stories need to be told. People need to hear about this. It’s really important.</p>
<h3>Interviewer:</h3>
<p>Could you explain what the Sixties Scoop is for people who aren’t aware?</p>
<h3>Inez Cook:</h3>
<p>Yeah, absolutely. Well, a little 101 First Nations history is that you know the government set up residential schools across the country which a lot of people have heard about recently. And you know all the children weren’t allowed to speak their language or learn their culture, grow up with their family. As a matter of fact, my biological mother she spoke her language fluently and they poured boiling hot water on her. She got third degree burns and she was hospitalized for three months. When they realized that her family was coming to visit her daily in the hospital the government went, “Oh no, this is too much family involvement.” So they operated her and moved her to another residential school in Alert Bay away from her family.
So what happened was is that there’s all these people that are broken. They didn’t grow up knowing how to be a daughter, knowing how to be a mother, knowing how to be a sister, knowing how to be a friend. They didn’t grow up understanding any of that. And then they had children and the government went, “Oh no, we forgot about this part.” Now these ones are having children. So they took us away and adopted us to non-indigenous families. I grew up without my status. I only got my status reinstated as an adult. But I have a biological sister and she was also adopted into another family and we also met as adults. So that’s another reason why I put my name on the list, just because I didn’t grow up with my sister. She’s become a great friend. But it wasn’t their right to do that, it wasn’t right.</p>
<h3>Interviewer:</h3>
<p>My heart. So your restaurant. How did you start your restaurant?</p>
<h3>Inez Cook:</h3>
<p>I have a business partner and we both fly for Canada full-time still. We tag team most of the time. So I was in Kelowna during the Wine Festival. And I saw that there was a Native restaurant there called Kekuli CafÃ© and I came back and I talked to one of my best friends Remy and I said, “You know, there is a native restaurant in Kelowna, we don’t have one in Vancouver anymore, the 2010 Olympics are coming here and we need a Native restaurant in this city and it’s crazy.” And he said, “I’ll work day and night, I’ll make it happen, let’s do it.” So we kind of dove in head first and now seven and a half years later here we are.</p>
<h3>Interviewer:</h3>
<p>And so food is a connection to your culture? And it was before you reconnected with your family?</p>
<h3>Inez Cook:</h3>
<p>It was weird because when I saw the sign “Don’t panic we have bannock” at the Kekuli CafÃ© in Kelowna, bannock triggered something. Oh my goodness I haven’t had bannock since I was a child. We made it at camp. And I knew that was native bread. And all of a sudden I wanted to learn more, I wanted to know more. Growing up I didn’t want to know anything about it. I saw drunk people in the ditch up in Northwest Territories who are they? They’re Natives and I’m not Native and that was it. I didn’t want to have any part of it. So it’s really nice to come full circle and to promote and showcase my heritage and be so proud. I was just making a joke at our food demo saying, “First Nations, we’re in.”</p></section></body></html>
