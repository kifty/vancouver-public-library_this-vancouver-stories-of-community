<h1>Grace Eiko Thompson: "Education Is The Only Solution"</h1>

<i>Grace Eiko Thompson was interviewed the 29th of April, 2017 at Saint Joseph the Worker Parish as part of the This Vancouver Story City project. She was interviewed at the same time as Judy Hanazawa (the next interview in this book). This is an excerpt of a longer interview.</i>

<h3>Grace Eiko Thompson:</h3>

<p>My name is Grace Eiko Thompson. I'm a retired person of course, and a senior, and I was a child when we were interned, and I used to be ... I'm sorry, I'm making a mess. But I'm a historian and curator. I began as curator of art exhibitions, and then I've been working with the Japanese Canadian National Museum. I was the first Director Curator.</p>

<h3>Interviewer:</h3>

<p>I was going to ask whether you can start with your family's journey to Vancouver perhaps.</p>

<h3>Grace Eiko Thompson:</h3>

<p>I was born in Steveston Japanese Fisherman's Hospital in Steveston. Many children in those days went to that hospital because that was the first Japanese Canadian hospital. In fact, it was very interesting that in Steveston, in producing this hospital, I would say that it was probably one of the first or the first Medicare or Canada's ... The Medicare that we have today. They already had it within that community, and that hospital, the members paid $6 or whatever a year to be a member. But the hospital is open anyone who want it. They had a plaque ceremony a few years ago and I went to it, and I was very surprised to see that not just Japanese Canadians, but other residents of Steveston were born there or had received service from that. Steveston is a very important part of Japanese Canadian history. Of course, because that's where the fisherman first came. The immigrants from Japan came as fisherman there, including my uncles.</p>

<p>My father didn't come until he was 19 years old after he had finished school. He came around 1921 or so, but he was told by his brothers not to get into fish, but to go and learn English. So, as a result of that he kind of traveled across all the way to Winnipeg, worked on the railway lines, and worked in the CPR hotels learning English. And then several years later he went back to Japan and his parents had arranged for his marriage. So, my mother came in 1930. And my father was told not to fish, but to learn English.</p>

<p>In the 1930s he got a job in Vancouver in what is called Codfish Cooperative, which was a co-op that was a cooperative that included Aboriginal, Japanese Canadians, and Caucasians. So, that's where he was working, and in 1942 we were told that we had to leave our homes. We were living on Alexander Street in Vancouver.</p>

<p>So, I was seven years old, I was going to Strathcona School, and because my mother was expecting her last child, which was her fifth child, we decided to move to Steveston where my uncle was living, and my uncle's family was in Japan at that time, so he was living alone. So, he said, "Why don't you come and move with me?" So, we moved to Steveston because Steveston has the Fisherman's hospital. So, my younger sister was also born there. Then the Steveston fisherman were all pretty well to do, they're well established. So, they decided to go to a self-supporting place rather than the usual internment sites.
So, we went to a place called Ninto Mines, which was a lost gold mine town, and so we spent the next few years there until 1944 or so, 44 or 45 just when the war ended. We were told that we couldn't go back to our homes in Vancouver. In any event, the government had sold all our properties. Soon after the internment, we moved [to internment] around April of 1942, by January 1943 they were already starting to sell our properties. We had nothing to go back to. And then we were told to go east of the Rockies or go to Japan.</p>

<p>My family decided that we would go to Manitoba because my father had been on the railway line, and knew that area, but we weren't allowed to go into the city, so we were living in a couple of farm villages in Manitoba before we received notice of freedom of movement in 1949/50. So, in 1950 we moved to Winnipeg.</p>

<p>That's the internment years, and I would say that as someone whose life was totally changed, I never really had a normal life because we were always moving, plus my mother could not speak English. So, I was interpreting for her from the time I was little, and my father took a job wherever he could get. So, often, very often he was not living with us. He was coming home every second weekend. My brothers too. My younger brothers were raised without proper guidance of a father, and the mother who couldn't speak English. The responsibility for me was to look after my brothers. We would go to school together, and if there was a meeting a teacher, I was the one who went to the meetings even though I was a kid.</p>

<p>My life was totally dictated by the events of my life, and I didn't go to university until I was married because before that in the 50s my parents were settling, and the first jobs I was getting was ... I had trained myself to be a stenographer in order to pay for my mortgage. I started going to university after I was married, and then I focused on not making money or having a good job so much as dealing with my own identity issues. I took courses like Asian art history in order to know about what my cultural background is, and western cultures. I studied those things, and so eventually I became a curator and a historian, and then when I moved to Vancouver 22 years ago, and I came to the Burnaby Art Gallery as a curator. The Burnaby Art Gallery was taken over by the city, so I quit because I don't like a bureaucratic job.</p>

<p>So, what happened then is the Japanese Canadian National Museum was being put together, and they asked me to be a consultant. I worked for almost a year as a volunteer consultant, then they hired me as their first Director Curator because in order to apply for money you had to have a position. During that period I totally focused on our history, and really got to understand it. So, I would say that my whole life was dictated by the politics of our time, and I'm now 83 years old, and I have two sons, and five grandchildren. I'm very blessed, and I have no regrets now that for many years I was very angry.
So, I'm very lucky that I'm in good health, and also that I have resolved things within myself.</p>

<h3>Interviewer:</h3>

<p>I heard during one of the reconciliation events a couple of years ago, the sort of second generation effects of traumatic events like the Holocaust, like internment. Do you feel like you've seen those kinds of effects in the later generations of the Japanese community? Did you actually see what happened?</p>

<h3>Grace Eiko Thompson:</h3>

<p>Well, it's not so much repercussions as Canada is still not able to get over racist attitudes, and there's still a large segment of our communities that don't want to accept outsiders, even though the outsiders are the ones who are making Canada. Even before I was born in 1907 there was a White Canada Only Demonstration in Vancouver, where they came and smashed windows and things. And then of course our internment too. They called us security risks, but it had nothing to do with security risks. Before the war, we didn't even have the right to vote, and my parents were naturalized Canadians. I don't know what that means, and we were born in Canada.</p>

<p>But in the United States, if you were born in the United States you automatically became, according to the constitution, you become a full citizen. In Canada, that wasn't the case. Even if you were born here, you never became citizens. So, for that reason like in 1942 when we were interned, under the Geneva Convention you can't intern them. It's only for aliens. But then we didn't have the right to vote, even though we were called naturalized Canadians. So, that meant that if that the government evoked the War Measures Act, which allowed them to act through cabinet, not Parliament to put out order for our internment and all that.</p>

<p>So, in a way what happened to us is that the government of Canada, they labeled us enemy aliens, which meant that we were aliens. But they didn't call it internment, they called evacuation, so like we were saved. So, but we know that we weren't treated as full citizens, so we feel it's justified to say we were interned.</p>

<p>And even today for instance, with refugees coming and all that, there are a lot of people-- I don't know why they think they own this country when in fact it was taken over by displacing the First Nations people-- and they think they have a right to this place that it is White Canada Only, that attitude still remains.</p>

<p>It's kind of sad. So, the 150th Anniversary, at least we had truth and reconciliation. Canadians are getting to know what happened to the Aboriginal communities, and I think that is a wonderful thing that we are slowly starting. At the same time, on the other hand, we still have a lot of racist attitudes. Things haven't changed that much in my opinion, but I did work with Chief Robert Joseph on his Reconciliation Canada project, and it was really a wonderful experience for me. A horrible experience learning about what happened to them, but for me I realized that ... through my career in working with the Inuit in the Northwest Territories, and then the Cree in Saskatchewan, I've worked with those communities, and realized that Japanese Canadians are not the only ones who have been maltreated, and that helps you to resolve what you think was the worst thing that could happen.</p>

<p>I could equate that in the last few months. I've been having terrible back pains. I pulled my back, and I think to myself, "Is that's all that's wrong with me," I look around and there's so many people having so many other horrible problems. So, you can't kind of always think about how terrible things are for you. There's much worse things going on around you. For me meeting Chief Robert Joseph, and taking part of Reconciliation Canada was a really good experience for me. I'm currently doing a lot of work in community work. Volunteer work.</p>

<h3>Interviewer:</h3>

<p>Just to bring this back to when you first returned to Vancouver. What made that decision for you?</p>

<h3>Grace Eiko Thompson:</h3>

<p>I returned to Vancouver only 22 years ago, and that decision was because my parents had moved back here in the 60s, and my mother had lost two of her children, and as well her husband, and she was alone. So, I came back here. My younger brother was still living, but even there my mother lost three of her children before she died. So, I came back mainly because my mother was alone.</p>

<p>My parents moved back here in 1961, and in her memoir she writes that when came, because they came up by train in those days, she said when she saw the mountains and everything, she said she had feelings of nostalgia returning to this place where they had started their marriage, their family life. She says this. But for me I can't say that I felt that at all because Winnipeg had been my whole life, and now that coming back here probably made me face my own history much more closely than if I had remained in Winnipeg because Winnipeg at that time when I was growing up, we were probably the first Asian people that a lot of people saw. There were Chinese restaurants and things, but there weren't Chinese people or Japanese people walking the streets. So, you kind of assimilated into the community.
But when you come here you really feel the Asian presence, and also the presence of racism that. Racism is something that you can't erase totally. There's always somebody there who's going to make some comment. Even my children who are mixed, when they were little, I could tell from the people in our neighborhood that they saw my children as have a different mother. So, they're looked upon differently from other children. That's the first time I realized that my intermarrying didn't do anything in terms of getting rid of that aspect.<p>

<h3>Interviewer:</h3>

<p>So, when you returned to Vancouver, was there a particular neighborhood that you returned to?</p>

<h3>Grace Eiko Thompson:</h3>

<p>No, that's another thing. Japanese Canadians were told to go east of the Rockies, they called it a dispersal policy, and that meant that were told that we should not be clustered because we are causing racism by living clustered. That's what Prime Minister Mackenzie King said, and so we were careful not to live in the same neighborhood. So, when I came back to Vancouver of course, the area where the Japanese Canadians used to live in the Powell Street area, that had totally turned into a slum area, and it's reviving now. But even so, today there's the gentrification that's going on. The developers moving in, and the people who are living there now are getting displaced. So, that area has terrible history of displacement.</p>

<h3>Interviewer:</h3>

<p>Can you talk about the city apology?</p>

<h3>Grace Eiko Thompson:</h3>

<p>The city apologized, but at the same time what's apology? For me, city or the province or the Canadian government apologizing without really doing something tangible. I really think that education is a major thing that they failed on. Even if we get an apology they don't say, "Well, we're going to make sure this doesn't happen again, and it will be in the education system."</p>

<p>Seventy-five years later it's not in the school curriculum properly. It's supposed to be in the curriculum, but it's up to the teachers. So, the teachers have to learn this. If the government doesn't provide it in textbooks or whatever form, then the teachers are not going to take that time and energy to produce programs to teach it, because it's not up to them. It's on the curriculum, but it's up to the teachers. How or when you produce it.</p>

<h3>Interviewer:</h3>

<p>So, it's very individual based on teacher's willingness to do the education? So, did you go back to ...</p>

<h3>Grace Eiko Thompson:</h3>

<p>No, I didn't go back. No, no. I was renting because I was working at the Burnaby Art Gallery. When I first moved, I moved with a friend. So, we just chose anywhere. But I also lived in North Vancouver for a while and came over the Second Narrows Bridge to go to Burnaby Art Gallery to work. But finally, I live on Cambie and 16th now. I chose that area. My son was saying, "If you're not coming back to Winnipeg, then you should live somewhere where you can grow old without worrying about transportation and things." So, we chose that, and it's been a good choice.</p>

<p>So, it has nothing to do with our history because the area I had spent my first seven years in Vancouver is not an area that Japanese Canadians move back to. Because as I said it used to be a thriving community. It had everything. My mother didn't even have to learn English. All the streets were full of shops and everything. And that was totally destroyed. So, there was no reason to come back, but our community has the annual Powell Street Festival to remember this, and also a lot of our community, young people are now working Downtown East Side groups to try to help with dealing with issues like displacements, and the gentrification that is making it practically impossible for people living there as the rent goes up. And I'm troubled with rent going up. It doesn't mean that the provincial government is going to raise their benefits.</p>

<p>It's really at this moment Vancouver east side is going through terrible issues that have to be resolved, and I don't know how they can resolve it. But I'm really, really grateful, and happy that our younger generation within the Chinese community as well as the Japanese community are working in that community, helping. For me that didn't happen 10 years ago. Everybody tried to forget the past, and now there's much more attention paid to it. Because if you understand your past, then you can do something in the present because you don't want that to happen again. But if you don't know anything about your past, you don't do anything.</p>

<p>So, I think that things are changing, but the overall Vancouver situation, I don't think is getting better.</p>

<h3>Interviewer:</h3>

<p>Okay. I'd like to wrap up. Are there any last words that you'd like to tell?</p>

<h3>Grace Eiko Thompson:</h3>

<p>I think for me my end is getting near, and I'm still trying to write a bit of a memoir to leave behind because my mother left me one. So, the main thing is that act according to your heart, according to who you are, but also that I would really like to push education. To me, education is the only solution in my opinion, and I think our community, many of our community members know this, and they're working on it. We have really good people like Laura working on it, and Judy is the Human Rights Committee person. She's chair of our main organization. So, I feel very good that there are many people involved right now.</p>
