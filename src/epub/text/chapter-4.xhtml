			<h1>Julia Lane: “People See You When You’re Flustered</h1>
			<i>
			Julia Lane was interviewed on the 4th of August, 2017, at Mount Pleasant Community Centre, as part of the This Vancouver Story City project. This is a short excerpt of a longer interview. </i>
			<h3>Julia Lane:</h3>
			<p>I came into the library, I had my stroller, I had like way too much stuff with me, as I usually do. So I had too much stuff, and I had a library fine, which never happens because Iâm very fastidious about not having a library fines. I was flustered, and I was wanting to pay my library fine. It wasnât a lot of money, it was like $2, but I didnât have any cash, I was trying to find cash, couldnât find any cash. So can I just pay you this with my debit card? I know itâs dumb, itâs only $2. The librarian would say, âItâs okay, settle down youâre fine.â And then some person came up behind me and he was like, âIâll pay it for you, itâs fine,â and I was like, âNo, no, I can pay it.â Itâs not like I donât have the money. Heâs like, âNo, you look like youâre having a rough day.â I said, âIâm actually fine, Iâm not upset. I just have too many things and Iâm flustered.â And so he paid the library fine for me after much protestation on my part and he gave my son Felix, five bucks, and I was like, âWe really donât need to take your money sir. Like thank you, weâre fine.â And he was like, âNo, no, I want him to have it, itâs his now.â That was an interesting moment where I was like, all right, I must have come off very needy in this particular instance. But I just left feeling very like supported by the community here, feeling like, okay people see you when youâre flustered and might want to help out, so that was really nice.</p>
