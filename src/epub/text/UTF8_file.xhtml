			<h1>Jeremy Walker: â€œThe Drive Really Looked After Usâ€‌</h1>
			<i>
			Jeremy Walker was interviewed on the 22nd of July, 2017 at The Drum Is Calling Festival at Larwill Park as part of the This Vancouver Story City project. This is an excerpt of a longer interview.</i>
			<h3>Jeremy Walker:</h3>
			<p>Iâ€™m from Kitimat but kind of raised in Kitimat and Vancouver, both places. I used to come down for the summers all the time. Moved down in â€™99. I have a lot of family, I have a huge family here.</p>
			<h3>Interviewer:</h3>
			<p>So, what area would you go to?</p>
			<h3>Jeremy Walker:</h3>
			<p>East Van أ¢آ€آ¦ Commercial drive, yeah. When all those native housings went up we were the first ones in there. Yeah, it was crazy. There was probably about 150 of us, we were all, 100 of us maybe, we were all like 12 to 14 years old أ¢آ€آ¦ there was a lot of us, there was a lot of us. We used to travel, weأ¢آ€آ™ll walk around, thereأ¢آ€آ™d be like 30 or 40 of us, all just little kids. We were bad. We were really bad. Thatأ¢آ€آ™s when all the residential schools was coming out so أ¢آ€آ¦ weأ¢آ€آ™re the first generation that wasnأ¢آ€آ™t in residential school أ¢آ€آ¦</p>
			<p>The Drive really looked after us, Joeأ¢آ€آ™s Cafأƒآ© used to give us donuts and coffee and hot chocolates all the time. Iأ¢آ€آ™m like, أ¢آ€آœLetأ¢آ€آ™s go see Joe!أ¢آ€آ‌ whenever we got hungry. Heأ¢آ€آ™s like, heأ¢آ€آ™s shake his head, heأ¢آ€آ™d be kind of like, أ¢آ€آœYou guys canأ¢آ€آ™t come, keep doing this all the timeأ¢آ€آ‌ أ¢آ€آ¦ He really liked us, eh. He really, and the bus drivers all watched us grow up too. The bus drivers used to let us, certain bus drivers would never get mad. Theyأ¢آ€آ™d let us on all the time and talk to us. Theyأ¢آ€آ™re like, you guys got to calm down and stuff. So, it was like, East Van really, they watched out for us. Itأ¢آ€آ™s pretty good. Yeah, living on the Drive was so much culture and stuff there, and so much people that want to see us do good.</p>
			<p>It used to be really hard for a Native growing up like there wasnأ¢آ€آ™t as much opportunity, there wasnأ¢آ€آ™t much anything. But nowadays, the racism, itأ¢آ€آ™s very rare in East Van. Farther you go youأ¢آ€آ™ll notice itأ¢آ€آ™s a little bit more. Go to Surrey, go to North Van, you know, go past Chilliwack, you know. Itأ¢آ€آ™s more stereotyped there but East Van, thereأ¢آ€آ™s so many of us out here and أ¢آ€آ¦ a lot of us are doing really good. A lot of us donأ¢آ€آ™t drink or do drugs anymore too. People are like أ¢آ€آœWhat?أ¢آ€آ‌ Because we get that stereotype and we get stereotyped and they just canأ¢آ€آ™t believe that we donأ¢آ€آ™t drink or do drugs anymore. Iأ¢آ€آ™m like yeah, itأ¢آ€آ™s been a while. And thereأ¢آ€آ™s a lot of us. Thereأ¢آ€آ™s a lot of us. Me and my cousins had a show, the Snotty Nose Rez Kids, they had a show and then we went there and there was about 10 of us not drinking. Everybody couldnأ¢آ€آ™t believe it. أ¢آ€آœWhy, you guys arenأ¢آ€آ™t drinking?أ¢آ€آ‌ The whole tableأ¢آ€آ™s like yeah, none of us drink here. And they were like, from all over the nation because it was the Kanata Fest, they paid for a lot to bring people here. They were paying for their fare and everything, paying for their hotels. This thingأ¢آ€آ™s huge. So, and theyأ¢آ€آ™re all meeting us and weأ¢آ€آ™re meeting all these famous people and theyأ¢آ€آ™re like, they canأ¢آ€آ™t believe weأ¢آ€آ™re not drinking. Like, أ¢آ€آœwhatأ¢آ€آ™s up with you guys? Thatأ¢آ€آ™s really coolأ¢آ€آ‌. They think weأ¢آ€آ™re really cool. We try, we try to be cool. We try hard.</p>
